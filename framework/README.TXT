This is the framework for the Laborübung Visualisierung.
The project is set up with Visual Studio 2005, but can also be converted to VS2008.

The framework includes some basic funtionality to load a volume (in dat format) and to display slices of this volume. The usage of some of the base classes is demonstrated in this simple example. Other classes (Matrix, Quaternion, Vector) are not used but can be helpful for the implementation of the VisLU example.
